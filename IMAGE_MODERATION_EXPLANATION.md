# 📸 Profile Photo Rules - Simple Guide

## What This Does
Every time someone uploads a photo, our smart system checks it automatically in 3-5 seconds. If the photo breaks any rules, it gets rejected immediately and the user sees a clear message explaining why.

## 🔍 The Upload Process (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: User Uploads Photo
Someone tries to upload a profile picture or gallery photo.

### Step 2: Our System Checks the Photo
The AI looks at the photo and asks 8 simple questions:

1. **Is there a human face?** (Can we see eyes, nose, mouth?)
2. **Is this a real person?** (Not a cartoon, drawing, or animal)
3. **Is this their own photo?** (Not a celebrity or stock photo)
4. **Is it appropriate?** (No nudity or inappropriate content)
5. **Is it real?** (Not AI-generated or fake)
6. **Is it a document?** (Not a receipt, screenshot, or card)
7. **Does it have text on it?** (No watermarks or meme text)
8. **Is it a personal photo?** (Not professional photography)

If ALL answers are YES → ✅ **Photo is approved**  
If ANY answer is NO → ❌ **Photo is rejected**

### Step 3: Instant Result
- **If Approved:** Photo appears on their profile immediately
- **If Rejected:** Photo is deleted and they see a clear message explaining why
